# RemoveEquipmentLevelInflation

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that forces all parts to level 1 in combat.

It is compatible with game version **1.1.2-b5993** (Epic/Steam).

**Note:** parts for player mechs are set to level 1 on game load. This affects both parts loaded out on mechs and in the inventory. If you save a game with this mod loaded, all your parts in the save will be down-leveled to 1. You have been warned.

This isn't a useful mod on its own. Leveling is a core concept in the game so there's more to it than the number you see on the part display. This mod is limited to fixing the part level at 1. There a number of other places in the game that use the level concept, such as the enemy level shown in the briefing screen, and those levels are not changed.

One quirk of using this mod is that the game will spawn enemy squads with more and more units as the threat level grows. Maxing out the threat level in a province is a guaranteed way to have some pretty big fights.

This mod is a building block to switching the game away from level as a progression metric to something else.
